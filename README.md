🪨 Rock Paper Scissors Game ✂️
A simple command-line Rock, Paper, Scissors game built with Python. You play against the computer by selecting an option — and the game decides the winner based on the classic rules!

🎮 How to Play
Run the game in your terminal or any Python environment.

You'll be prompted to choose:

0 for Rock

1 for Paper

2 for Scissors

The computer will randomly select one of the three options.

The game then compares both choices and displays the result:

Rock crushes Scissors

Paper covers Rock

Scissors cuts Paper

🧠 Game Logic
If both the player and computer choose the same, it's a tie.

The game determines the winner using a series of if-elif conditions.

ASCII art is used to visually represent the choices.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Random module (for computer's choice)
